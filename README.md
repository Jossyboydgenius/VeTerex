Business Models

SaaS for recruiters/studios: subscription access to searchable verified completions and candidate contact leads.
API / Data licensing: paid API access and aggregated analytics sold to studios, publishers, and brands.
Marketplace & commissions: marketplace for creators (services, promo deals) with platform take-rate on transactions.
Sponsored campaigns & placement: brands pay to run campaigns, pay creators with completion NFTs or fiat.
Premium features: charge for advanced filtering, batch export, CRM integrations, or token-gated job boards.
Verification & audits: paid verification services (proof-of-watch/learn audits) and KYC for enterprise customers.
Events & experiences: ticketed, NFT-gated events, workshops, or paid AMAs with creators.
Advertising & affiliate: targeted ads or affiliate revenue from driving subscriptions/merch to partners.
Royalties / Secondary sales: create paid drops, merch, or experiences tied to NFTs and collect royalties.

Ways Your Audience Can Earn (while minting stays free)

Bounties & paid tasks: brands/recruiters post paid tasks (review, create clips); users submit proof, earn fiat or tokens.
Referral rewards: refer users or partners and earn cash, platform credits, or tokens per onboarding/engagement.
Token rewards / points: issue a platform token or points for completions, redeemable for cash, perks, or listings.
Creator gigs & hiring: recruiters pay creators discovered via completion NFTs for writing, reviews, or paid sponsorships.
Curator incentives: users who curate high-quality completions (tags, reviews) earn fees or reputation-based payouts.
Affiliate conversions: users get affiliate commissions for driving sales/subscriptions from their completion pages.
NFT-gated revenue share: hold specific completion NFTs to unlock revenue-splitting streams (ad rev, sponsorships).
Leaderboard & prize pools: weekly/monthly contests with token/prize pools funded by sponsors.
Micro-tipping & tipping pools: viewers tip creators for notable reviews/discoveries; platform takes a small fee.
Paid certification & premium badges: offer paid verified certificates or pro badges that creators can sell or use to get jobs.

Mechanics to Keep Minting Free but Sustainable

Free minting, paid utility: charge for discovery, exports, recruiter contacts, or API calls rather than minting.
On-ramp monetization: make certain premium metadata updates, verifications, or commercial uses paid.
Tokenomics: distribute a small % of platform revenue to a staking pool for token holders (incentivizes early users).
Conditional fees: marketplace/listing fees only when creators monetize their completions (no upfront charge).
Sponsor-backed rewards: brands sponsor bounty pools that pay users for specific completion actions.
