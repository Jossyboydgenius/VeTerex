# Tracking Media

VeTerex automatically tracks your media consumption on supported platforms. Here's how it works.

## How Tracking Works

```
📺 You watch/read on a supported platform
           ↓
🔍 VeTerex detects your activity
           ↓
📊 Progress is tracked in real-time
           ↓
✅ Completion detected when 100% done
           ↓
🎖️ You can mint your NFT!
```
