# Minting NFTs

When you complete media, you earn the right to mint a soulbound NFT as proof of your achievement.

## What is a Completion NFT?

A VeTerex NFT represents:

- ✅ **Proof of completion** - You actually finished the media
- ✅ **Permanent record** - On-chain forever
- ✅ **Your identity** - Bound to your wallet
- ✅ **Community access** - Join groups of fellow completers

## Minting Process

### Automatic Flow (with Tracking)

1. **Complete Media**
   - Finish watching/reading on a supported platform
   
2. **Get Notified**
   - VeTerex detects completion
   - You receive a "Ready to Mint" notification

3. **Confirm Mint**
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │  🎉 Completion Detected!        │

## Minting is FREE

VeTerex covers gas fees for all completion mints. You don't need to:

- ❌ Pay gas fees
- ❌ Hold $VERY tokens
- ❌ Worry about transaction costs

## NFT Properties

Each NFT contains:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Token ID** | Unique identifier |
| **Media ID** | Reference to the media |
| **Media Type** | Book, Movie, Anime, etc. |
| **Media Name** | Title of the content |
| **URI** | Metadata/image reference |

## Soulbound = Non-Transferable

This ensures authenticity - your achievements are truly yours!
