# Community & Groups

One of VeTerex's most powerful features is connecting you with others who share your achievements.

## The Power of Shared Experiences

When two people have both completed the same book, movie, or show, there's an instant connection. VeTerex makes these connections possible through verified, on-chain proof.

## Groups

### What are Groups?

Groups are communities of users who have all completed the same media. Each piece of media has its own group.

### Joining a Group

**Requirement:** You must own the completion NFT

1. Complete the media and mint your NFT
2. Go to the media detail page
3. Click "Join Group"
4. You're in!

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  📺 Attack on Titan            │
│  ─────────────────────         │
│  👥 1,234 members              │
│                                 │
│  [✅ Joined] or [Join Group]   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Group Features
