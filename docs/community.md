# community

One of VeTerex's most powerful features is connecting you with others who share your achievements.

## The Power of Shared Experiences

When two people have both completed the same book, movie, or show, there's an instant connection. VeTerex makes these connections possible through verified, on-chain proof.

## Groups

### What are Groups?

Groups are communities of users who have all completed the same media. Each piece of media has its own group.

### Joining a Group

**Requirement:** You must own the completion NFT

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Complete the media and mint your NFT

Complete the media and mint your completion NFT.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Go to the media detail page

Navigate to the detail page for the media you completed.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click "Join Group"

Use the Join Group action on the media page.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### You're in!

You are now a member of the group's community.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Finding Similar Users

### How It Works

VeTerex can identify users who share completions with you:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Go to "Find Similar Users"

Open the Find Similar Users tool.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select NFTs from your collection

Choose the NFTs you want to use for matching.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### See users who have matching completions

View the list of users who share one or more of those completions.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### The More Matches, The Better

Users are ranked by how many completions you share:

| Shared NFTs | Connection Strength |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| 1           | 💫                  |
| 3-5         | ⭐⭐                  |
| 6+          | 🌟🌟🌟              |

## Messaging

### Who Can You Message?

You can message other users if:

* You both have completed the same media

```
canText(you, them, mediaId) → true/false
```
