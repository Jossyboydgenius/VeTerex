## What is VeTerex?

VeTerex is a **decentralized media verification platform** that allows users to track their consumption of various media types and mint soulbound NFTs as proof of completion.

### The Problem

In today's digital age, we consume massive amounts of content - books, movies, anime, TV shows, and more. But there's no verifiable way to prove what you've actually completed. Traditional lists can be faked, and social bragging rights mean nothing without proof.

### The Solution

VeTerex creates an **on-chain record** of your media completions through:

1. **Automatic Tracking** - Our Chrome extension monitors your viewing/reading progress on supported platforms
2. **Verification** - Backend systems verify genuine completion before minting
3. **Soulbound NFTs** - Non-transferable tokens permanently linked to your wallet

### How It Works
