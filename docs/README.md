# Welcome to VeTerex 🎬

> **Track your media journey. Earn verified achievements. Connect with your community.**

VeTerex is a decentralized platform for tracking and verifying media consumption achievements using soulbound NFTs on the Verychain blockchain.

## What is VeTerex?

VeTerex allows you to:

- 📚 **Track Media Consumption** - Books, Movies, Anime, Manga, TV Shows, and more
- 🎖️ **Earn Soulbound NFTs** - Non-transferable tokens that prove your genuine completions
- 👥 **Connect with Others** - Find and chat with users who share your achievements
